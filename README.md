# FTP-project-RC2425T03G12

A simple FTP client implementation, developed in the context of RC's Project 2 @ FEUP.
Handles errors, has anonymous and authenticated access, and can download files of all sizes tested so far (up to ~380MB was tested).
Also presents detailed server responses to the user, a feature we thought was lacking in other implementations published online.
